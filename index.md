                     <p class="lead mb-5">Hello Everyone! :)</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"> I am a Grace Hopper Scholar who has a strong record of experience and proven ability to provide analytical insights to drive improvements and business growth. I have a proficiency in handling projects from core to completion with 3+ years of experience as a Marketing Executive and Analyst. My interest for visualizing data and creating insightful stories, along with inclination towards mathematics and managements motivates me to work in the field of analytics. I am a conscientious person who pays attention to detail and is highly organized. I prefer being around and work with people as it motivates me and makes me happy. I consider myself a tactile learner as I learn the best by doing a hands-on activity. </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"> I am a Masters graduate from San Jose State University. I have an undergraduate in computer science and MBA in Marketing and Finance.</p>

After examining the company’s supply chain strategy it was concluded that the supply chain of the company is overdependent on one particular geographical location, which if under a bottleneck, may starve the entire supply chain process, creating havoc in the system.</p>
